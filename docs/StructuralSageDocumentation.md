# Structural Sage Documentation

## Overview

Structural Sage is a web application that combines Kanban board functionality with a chat interface, allowing users to manage tasks and communicate effectively. The application is built using React, TypeScript, and various supporting libraries.

## Workflow

1. Users can switch between Kanban board and Chat views.
2. In the Kanban view, users can:
   - Create, edit, and delete boards
   - Add, edit, move, and delete tasks within boards
   - Split text into multiple cards
3. In the Chat view, users can:
   - Send and receive messages
   - View chat history
   - Convert chat messages into Kanban cards

## Backend Structure

Currently, the application does not have a dedicated backend. It uses local storage for data persistence. The main data structures are:

1. Boards: Array of board objects, each containing:
   - id: string
   - name: string
   - columns: Object of Column objects

2. Columns: Object with column IDs as keys, each containing:
   - id: string
   - title: string
   - tasks: Array of Task objects

3. Tasks: Array of task objects, each containing:
   - id: string
   - content: string

4. Conversations: Array of conversation objects, each containing:
   - id: string
   - messages: Array of ChatMessage objects
   - lastTimestamp: Date

5. ChatMessages: Array of message objects, each containing:
   - id: string
   - content: string
   - timestamp: Date

## Key Components

1. App.tsx: Main component managing state and routing
2. Sidebar.tsx: Navigation and board management
3. KanbanBoard.tsx: Kanban board functionality
4. ChatWindow.tsx: Chat interface
5. BoardList.tsx: List of Kanban boards
6. ErrorBoundary.tsx: Error handling component

## Core Functionality

1. Kanban Board Management:
   - Create, rename, and delete boards
   - Add, edit, and move tasks between columns
   - Drag-and-drop functionality for tasks

2. Chat System:
   - Send and receive messages
   - Group messages into conversations
   - Display chat history

3. Integration Features:
   - Split text into multiple Kanban cards
   - Convert chat messages to Kanban tasks

4. Data Persistence:
   - Save boards and chat history to local storage
   - Load data from local storage on app initialization

## Potential Next Steps

1. Firebase Integration:
   - Set up Firebase project and configure SDK
   - Implement real-time database for Kanban boards and chat messages
   - Add user authentication and authorization
   - Migrate from local storage to Firebase for data persistence

2. ChatGPT API Integration:
   - Obtain API key and set up secure key management
   - Implement API calls to ChatGPT for intelligent responses
   - Enhance chat functionality with AI-powered suggestions and task generation

3. Enhanced Kanban Features:
   - Add due dates and priorities to tasks
   - Implement filtering and sorting options for tasks
   - Create board templates and task templates

4. Improved Chat Functionality:
   - Add support for file attachments and rich media in chat
   - Implement @mentions and notifications
   - Add search functionality for chat history

5. User Experience Improvements:
   - Implement user onboarding and tooltips
   - Add keyboard shortcuts for common actions
   - Create a mobile-responsive design

6. Performance Optimization:
   - Implement lazy loading for chat history and boards
   - Optimize rendering of large Kanban boards
   - Add caching mechanisms for frequently accessed data

7. Testing and Quality Assurance:
   - Implement unit tests for core components and functions
   - Add integration tests for key user flows
   - Set up continuous integration and deployment pipeline

8. Analytics and Monitoring:
   - Implement usage analytics to track user behavior
   - Add error logging and monitoring
   - Create dashboards for key metrics and performance indicators

By implementing these next steps, Structural Sage will evolve into a more robust, feature-rich application with improved scalability, intelligence, and user experience.
